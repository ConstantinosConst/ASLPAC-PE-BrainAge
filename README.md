# ASLPAC-PE-BrainAge
This repository provides code/scripts for secondary data analyses as reported in the following manuscript: Constantinides, C., Caramaschi, D., Zammit, S., Freeman, T. P., &amp; Walton, E. (2024). Exploring associations between psychotic experiences and structural brain age: a population-based study in late adolescence [WORKING PAPER]

## Step 1. Sample selection and relevant variables
A desicription of the ALSPAC variables (and recoding) used for the current analyses can be found in the relevant spreadsheet: 'Variables_Info_ALSPAC_PE_CC_09092024.xlsx'. The R code used to extract the SCZ-RbG subsample (and relevant variables) from the wider ALSPAC cohort will be added soon.

## Step 2. Brain age estimation

a. For guidance on brain age prediction using the the CentileBrain model, please refer to the following resource: https://centilebrain.org/#/brainAge2

b. For guidance on brain age prediction using the ENIGMA model (supplementary analysis), please refer to the following resources: (a) https://photon-ai.com/enigma_brainage, (b) https://github.com/ConstantinosConst/ENIGMA-SZ-BrainAge

## Step 3. Statistical analyses

The R code used for statistical analyses (incl. sample discriptives and data visualisation) can be found in the relevant script: 'ALSPAC_PE_BA_Stats_CC_09092023'. Scripts for producing correlations between brain age and FreeSurfer measure (feature imprtortance) will be added soon.
